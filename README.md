## Mobile Robot using ROS2

This repository contains the source folder files to control the simple my_bot (2 motorized wheels and 1 caster wheel) in a gazebo simulation and later in real world using a raspberry Pi and serveral sensors. The development of the robot and the majority of scripts are based on a tutorial session by [Josh Newans](https://github.com/joshnewans/).
